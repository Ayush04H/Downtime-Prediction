# Manufacturing Downtime Prediction System

## Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning system to predict manufacturing equipment downtime using various sensor measurements and operational parameters. The system uses a **Decision Tree classifier** to make binary predictions (Yes/No) about potential machine downtime.
